Swallow many-core research project progress web site

This repository contains work relating to the Swallow Research Project, which was carried out at the University of Bristol, UK.
Particular emphasis is on documentation, with much of the implementation being stored in other (linked to) repositories.
As time goes on, the aim is to migrate these code here too.

Project maintainers are Simon Hollis and Steve Kerrison.
